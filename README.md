## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- `pandas`  
- `numpy`  
- `sqlalchemy`  
- `sqlite3`  
- Other standard Python libraries

## 🔄 ETL Pipeline Stages

1. **Extract**  
   - Load data from one or more sources (CSV, API, or database).

2. **Transform**  
   - Clean, normalize, and structure the data using `pandas`.

3. **Load**  
   - Store the processed data in a relational database using `sqlite3` and `SQLAlchemy`.
